# ConnectionsCodeTest

The project is intended to expose a web service endpoint using SpringBoot framework. The project contains SpringBoot application class, a resource file, a test case file and test suite class. Please get the project and run it as project in your Eclipse IDE, the .project, .classpath and pom.xml will set the project environment correctly to run the project. The web service endpoint exposed is http://localhost:8080/connected with the parameters origin and destination. The main SpringBoot application is a java application class, which will start the whole application to bind the 8080 port on your machine with the context root as connected. Sample URLs are as shown below.

http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=New%20York

http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Atlanta&destination=New%20York
